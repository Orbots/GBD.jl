Since Julia is our implementation language we stick with 1-based indexing and choose to place the degenerate basis element as the last element of a 1-vector to mirror the use of w in a Vector Algebra setting.  i.e. $e_1*e_1 == 1$, $e_2*e_2 == 1$, $e_3*e_3 == 1$, and $e_4*e_4 == 0$ for 3D projective geometry.\n",
